# Capstone--Travel-App
## Capstone-Travel App with udacity project
A travel application has been created that obtains the location and date of the userâ€™s desired trip, in addition to the weather condition on the specified date. If it is more than 7 days away, the expected weather condition
is given with its lowest and highest value, and displays an image of the location using the information obtained from programming interfaces. External applications.
3 APIs were used one for location (latitude and longitude) the second for weather and the third to get an image of the location
### notes: Node.js version is v20.10.0, npm version : 10.8.2

# Skills used:
## The main goal is to deal with APIs and how to fetch them. I used the axios library for this task
### I dealt with the concept of the document and getting elements from the DOM 
### And how to make access on the elements 
### Using getElementById or quereSelector methods
### Modifying the user interface using innerHTML 
### In addition to using callback functions and how do we use them appropriately
### and asynchronous Javascript function
### The user interface is designed using CSS and SASS

# From the server side:
### I built node js and used the Express library to build a server to deal with the client and API from the server side instead of the client side.
### In building the server, I used my knowledge of Webpack to organize the project files and compress them to reduce their size and increase its efficiency 
### I used service workers to run the project without the Internet, such as making a copy with the client 
### I created Unit Testing using Jest framework for some of the methods I used
### In the end, I uploaded the project to github and used git commands in cmd
